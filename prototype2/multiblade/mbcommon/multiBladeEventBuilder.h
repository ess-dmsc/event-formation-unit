/*! \mainpage Process the raw data from the Multi-blade detector.
 *
 * This class processes data-points from one cassette of the multi-blade detector.
 *
 * The data-points are first formed into clusters within a certain preset time-window. The clusters are then checked for
 * adjacency and if passed the position of the cluster will be determined. The position can be either determined as the
 * wire/strip with maximum signal of the cluster or be calculated using a weighted average with the signals as the
 * weights.
 *
 * This class is a reimplementation of clustering algorithm written in MatLab by
 * Francesco Piscitelli <Francesco.Piscitelli@esss.se>.
