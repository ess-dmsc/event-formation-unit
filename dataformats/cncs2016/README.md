#About

This project is written for analysing raw multigrid data as readout by
(some readout system) in experiments done in 2016 (and probably 2017).

Two programs are generated by the build process: cncsread and batchreader
each does some parsing and processing on raw readout data.

cncsread takes a single file argument and prints out some statistics. The batchreader
takes several arguments, generates a list of filenames, then reds and processes these.
The output is in tree files. This program takes a -h argument for help.

In addition there are some bash scripts and python scripts used for plotting the data.

## Build and Run

To build:

`> make`


__Run in terminal window__


`> ./cncsread inputfile`

`> ./batchreder -d dir -p prefix -o postfix -s start -e end -l low_thresh -f output`
