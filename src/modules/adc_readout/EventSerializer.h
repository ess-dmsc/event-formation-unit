  /// \param[in] Mode The

  ///    - Use the first timestamp in a set of events as the reference
  ///    timestamp.
  ///    - EventSerializer::addReferenceTimestamp() does nothing.
  ///    - A flatbuffer is produced when either:
  ///      - It is full.
  ///      - TransmitTimeout has passed since the first event.
  ///      - The difference between the reference timestamp and the current
  ///      event timestamp is greater than
  ///        std::numeric_limits<std::uint32_t>::max().
  ///  - TIME_REFERENCED
  ///    - Before the first call to EventSerializer::addReferenceTimestamp(),
  ///    buffer BufferSize events and use the
  ///      timestamp of the first event as the reference time.
  ///    - Use the timestamp from EventSerializer::addReferenceTimestamp() as a
  ///    reference timestamp.
  ///    - If the time difference between the last reference timestamp and the
  ///    event timestamp is greater than
  ///      std::numeric_limits<std::uint32_t>::max(), use the event timestamp as
  ///      the next reference.
  ///    - A flatbuffer is produced when either:

  ///      event timestamp is greater than
  ///        std::numeric_limits<std::uint32_t>::max().
