/// \brief macro RelAssertMsg() provides an assert with a message.
///
/// It's always on in Release builds, however it has only small perf
/// impact, as the condition expression is always expected to be true.
/// It's made to ensure correct failure modes in Google Test (compiled in
/// Debug) and when running large datasets, while cannot run well in
/// Debug builds.
///
/// \brief macro TestEnvAssertMsg() provides an assert when running in unit test
/// environment or in DEBUG builds. It should only be used to find invariant
/// breaking errors during testing, NOT as an error mechanism during production.
