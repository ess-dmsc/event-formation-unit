/// \brief AbstractAnalyzer declares the interface for an event analyzer type
///        that can take multi-dimensional Events and return a ReducedEvent
///        summaries that provide the best estimated coordinates and time
///        for a detected particle. Different strategies are to be implemented
///        for various detector types, depending on the particular physics.
