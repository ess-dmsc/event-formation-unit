This project implements processing of neutron detector event data into neutron events. Pipelines
for processing of raw data from Gd-GEM, Muli-Grid, Multi-Blade, SoNDe as well as a few other detectors
have been implemented. Mostly implemented in C/C++.

## Documentation
For more details on the file structure, architecture, primitives see [documentation/README.md](documentation/README.md)

## Getting started

The [essdaq repository](https://github.com/ess-dmsc/essdaq) has scripts for automatically
downloading and compiling this project. Instructions for manually compiling the event
formation unit software follow.

### Prerequisites

To build and run this software the following dependencies are required.

* [**Conan**](https://conan.io) The conan script has to be available in the current ``$PATH``. Use the latest version smaller than 2.
* [**CMake**](https://cmake.org) At least CMake version 2.8.12 is required. Some packages that requires more recent versions of CMake will download this as a dependency.
* [**bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) For properly setting paths to the conan provided dependencies.
* A recent C/C++ compiler with support for C++14.

Conan is used to download dependencies. For conan to know where the dependencies can
be downloaded from, the ecdc package repository must be added by running the following command:

* `conan remote add ecdc-conan-release https://artifactory.esss.lu.se/artifactory/api/conan/ecdc-conan-release`

Note also that for additional functionality you might want to install the following dependencies manually:

* [**libpcap**](http://www.tcpdump.org)
* [**Valgrind**](http://valgrind.org) For doing memory usage (and other) tests.
* **lcov/gcov/gcovr** Required to generate coverage reports.

### Building

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ess-dmsc/event-formation-unit.git

cd event-formation-unit

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make
```

#### Building under Ubuntu 16
Wen using conan to provide the dependencies, an extra option has to be provided:
`--settings compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11`. Thus the call to conan turns into:

```bash
conan install --build=outdated .. --settings compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
```

## Running the tests

### Unit tests
To run the unit tests for this project, run the following commands:

```
make runtest
```

### Other tests

It is also possible to get a test coverage report if the required prerequisites have been installed. To get the coverage report, run

```
make coverage
```

To run a memory leak test (using Valgrind), run:

```
make valgrind
```

## Running the event formation application

An example of the commands required to run an event formation pipeline (in this case the *freia* pipeline) follows:

```
make efu freia
cd bin
./efu -d ../modules/freia --nohwcheck
```

Note you will need to provide a config file in the case of the *freia* module as well.

To get the available command line arguments, use `-h` or `--help`. This works when providing a detector module argument as well. For example:
```
./efu -d ../modules/freia -h
```
