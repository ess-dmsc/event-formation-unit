This project implements processing of neutron detector event data into neutron events. Pipelines
for processing of raw data from Gd-GEM, Muli-Grid, Multi-Blade, SoNDe as well as a few other detectors
have been implemented. Mostly implemented in C/C++.

## Getting started

The [essdaq repository](https://github.com/ess-dmsc/essdaq) has scripts for automatically
downloading and compiling this project. Instructions for manually compiling the event
formation unit software follow.

### Prerequisites

To build and run this software the following dependencies are required.

* [**Conan**](https://conan.io) The conan script has to be available in the current ``$PATH``. Use the latest version smaller than 2.
* [**CMake**](https://cmake.org) At least CMake version 2.8.12 is required. Some packages that requires more recent versions of CMake will download this as a dependency.
* [**bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) For properly setting paths to the conan provided dependencies.
* A recent C/C++ compiler with support for C++14.

Note also that for additional functionality, you might want to install the following dependencies manually:

* [**libpcap**](http://www.tcpdump.org) —Network monitoring
* [**Valgrind**](http://valgrind.org) — Memory usage (and other) tests
* [**gcovr**](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/index.html), [**lcov**](https://lcov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#lcov),  and [**gcov**](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) — Generate coverage reports

## Install and Configure Conan

#### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### 2. Install Conan (version < 2)
```bash
pip install "conan<2"
```

#### 3. Verify Conan installation

```bash
conan --version
```

#### 4. Install the Conan configuration
This includes supported Conan profiles and access to the ECDC internal package repository:

```bash
conan config install http://github.com/ess-dmsc/conan-configuration.git
```

## Release Build

#### 1. Create a build directory:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies with Conan 

The ECDC Conan configuration includes a predefined profile: `linux_x86_64_gcc11`. 
This profile is well-tested and has many prebuilt binaries available in our remote repository. 
It's also the one we use in automated ci builds for this project.

If you're working on a different architecture (e.g. Apple Silicon) or using a different compiler (e.g. GCC 13), note that no predefined profiles exist in our config for those setups. 
In such cases, you'll need to use Conan's locally generated `default` profile. 


Verify your default profile exists:
```bash
conan profile show default
```

To install dependencies using your local profile:
```bash
conan install .. --build=missing
```

To use the ECDC-supported Linux x86 GCC 11 profile instead, add:
```bash
--profile=linux_x86_64_gcc11
```

#### 3. Configure the project with CMake:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

#### 4. Build the project:
```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Debug build for unit tests and coverage

#### 1. Create a build directory:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

#### 2. Install dependencies with Conan:
```bash
conan install .. --build=missing -s build_type=Debug
```

#### 3. Configure the project with CMake:
```bash
cmake -DCOV=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DGOOGLE_BENCHMARK=ON ..
```

#### 4. Run unit tests:

```bash
make runtest
```

#### 5. Generate coverage report:
```bash
make coverage_all
```

View the report:
```bash
open coverage/coverage.html
```

#### 6. To run a memory leak test, run:
```bash
make valgrind
```

## Building Doxygen docmentation

[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) documentation for the EFU C++ classes can be build by running

```bash
make doxygen
```

After the documentation has been build, the doxygen documentation tree can be accesed in the cmake build directory, by opening the file `doxygen/html/index.html`. 


## Running the event formation application

An example of the commands required to run an event formation pipeline (in this case the *freia* pipeline) follows:

```bash
make efu freia
cd bin
./efu -d ../modules/freia --nohwcheck
```

Note you will need to provide a config file in the case of the *freia* module as well.

To get the available command line arguments, use `-h` or `--help`. This works when providing a detector module argument as well. For example:
```bash
./efu -d ../modules/freia -h
```
